# Spec 0.2.5 — What to Expect: target metrics and timeline

## Goal

The "What to expect" toggle in each tactic card currently shows only the mechanism blurb. Add two pieces of information the user actually needs when interpreting their results: which metrics this tactic targets, and a rough timeline for when to see movement.

---

## Changes

### 1. Add two fields to every tactic in `tactics.js`

**`targetMetrics`** — array of metric keys: `totalSleep`, `deepSleep`, `remSleep`, `bodyBattery`. Already planned in spec-0.2; this spec implements it using keys (not display names) so future verdict logic can compare values directly against `calcTacticAvg` output without a lookup.

**`expectTimeline`** — one plain sentence describing the order and timing of expected metric movement.

| Tactic | `targetMetrics` | `expectTimeline` |
|---|---|---|
| Cold room | `['deepSleep', 'totalSleep']` | Deep Sleep often improves in the first week; Total Sleep follows as sleep onset shortens. |
| Blue blockers | `['totalSleep', 'bodyBattery']` | Total Sleep improves in 1–2 weeks as melatonin timing shifts; Body Battery follows. |
| Mouth tape | `['deepSleep', 'bodyBattery']` | Deep Sleep tends to move in the first week from fewer micro-awakenings; Body Battery follows. |
| Caffeine cutoff | `['deepSleep', 'remSleep']` | Deep Sleep improves in the first week; REM typically continues improving over 2–3 weeks as adenosine sensitivity fully recovers. |
| Morning sunlight | `['totalSleep', 'bodyBattery']` | Body Battery improves first (1–2 weeks) as your nervous system starts recovering more efficiently. Total Sleep improves as you start falling asleep at your intended time more reliably (2–4 weeks). |
| Consistent wake time | `['totalSleep', 'bodyBattery']` | Total Sleep improves as you start falling asleep at your intended time more reliably (1–2 weeks); Body Battery improves as the clock locks in (2–4 weeks). |
| No alcohol | `['remSleep', 'bodyBattery']` | REM recovers within the first week of abstinence; Body Battery follows. |
| 528 Hz playlist | `['totalSleep', 'bodyBattery']` | Some randomized studies show faster sleep onset and better subjective sleep quality from bedtime music. Objective metrics (Deep Sleep, REM) are inconsistent across studies — watch Total Sleep and Body Battery over 2–3 weeks. |

**528 Hz blurb replacement** (updated to be honest about the evidence):
> Relaxing music at bedtime can ease pre-sleep anxiety and signal wind-down. Any effect comes from relaxation, not 528 Hz specifically — studies find no evidence the frequency matters, and the "healing frequency" claims originate from numerology, not biology.

The `targetMetrics` for 528 Hz (`['totalSleep', 'bodyBattery']`) reflect the plausible relaxation pathway (faster onset → slightly more total sleep → slightly better HRV recovery), not a strong evidence claim. The `expectTimeline` text makes the evidence quality explicit.

### 2. Update the expanded "What to expect" section in `Home.jsx`

Currently (lines 173–175):
```jsx
{tacticInfo && expanded && (
  <p className="card-blurb">{tacticInfo.blurb}</p>
)}
```

Replace with a block that renders three pieces in order:

1. Blurb paragraph (mechanism explanation — unchanged text for most tactics)
2. "Targets:" row — metric chips, only rendered if `tacticInfo.targetMetrics` is present
3. Timeline paragraph — only rendered if `tacticInfo.expectTimeline` is present

Add a lookup at the top of `Home.jsx` (or alongside other constants):

```js
const METRIC_LABELS = {
  totalSleep: 'Total Sleep',
  deepSleep: 'Deep Sleep',
  remSleep: 'REM Sleep',
  bodyBattery: 'Body Battery',
}
```

```jsx
{tacticInfo && expanded && (
  <div className="card-blurb-block">
    <p className="card-blurb">{tacticInfo.blurb}</p>
    {tacticInfo.targetMetrics?.length > 0 && (
      <div className="expect-metrics">
        <span className="expect-metrics-label">Targets</span>
        {tacticInfo.targetMetrics.map(k => (
          <span key={k} className="expect-metric-chip">{METRIC_LABELS[k]}</span>
        ))}
      </div>
    )}
    {tacticInfo.expectTimeline && (
      <p className="card-blurb-timeline">{tacticInfo.expectTimeline}</p>
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

The timeline paragraph uses `card-blurb-timeline` (not `card-blurb`) to avoid inheriting the `border-top` that `.card-blurb` uses as a separator from card content above.

---

### 3. CSS additions in `App.css`

```css
.card-blurb-block {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 0.5rem;
}

.expect-metrics {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 0.375rem;
}

.expect-metrics-label {
  font-size: 0.7rem;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 0.05em;
  color: var(--text-secondary);
  margin-right: 0.25rem;
}

.expect-metric-chip {
  font-size: 0.75rem;
  padding: 0.15rem 0.5rem;
  border-radius: 999px;
  background: var(--surface-raised);
  color: var(--text-secondary);
}

.card-blurb-timeline {
  font-size: 13px;
  color: var(--text);
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

## Out of scope

- No changes to Airtable or `airtable.js`
- No changes to tests (data-only addition to `tactics.js`; JSX change has no pure-function logic to test)
- No changes to `Log.jsx`
- Custom tactics (stored in localStorage) have no `targetMetrics` or `expectTimeline` — the conditional rendering handles this gracefully (both fields simply absent)
